    "# Mixed meshes\n",
    "\n",
    "There exists a preliminary support for mixed meshes, i.e. meshes combining\n",
    "multiple element types such as triangles and quadrilaterals.  This is mostly\n",
    "because the implementation of :func:`~skfem.assembly.asm` supports lists of\n",
    ":class:`~skfem.assembly.basis.AbstractBasis` objects and the resulting matrices\n",
    "of the multiple assembly operations is combined in the end.\n",
    "\n",
    "The working principle is that a list of meshes is created by the user, one for\n",
    "each element type.  Then the finite element basis is created separately for\n",
    "each mesh.  Finally, the list of basis objects is passed on to\n",
    ":func:`~skfem.assembly.asm`.\n",
    "\n",
    "This example demonstrates how a mesh generated by Gmsh, consisting of triangles\n",
    "and quadrilaterals, can be used to solve the Poisson problem with unit load.\n",
    "Currently the user must verify that the finite element bases are compatible\n",
    "with one another.  Moreover, the mixed meshes work properly only with finite\n",
    "elements that have nodal degrees-of-freedom.  Support for higher-order elements\n",
    "on mixed meshes is work-in-progress.\n",
